In simple terms, a heat pipe is a device that is used to transfer heat from one surface to the environment with principally no surplus energy expenditure (passive heat transfer). Not only do these heat pipes transfer heat at a higher rate but also they do so even if the temperature difference between the source and heat pipe is very small.</p>

      <h2 class="my-5">Structure of Heat pipe</h2>
      <p><div class="introduction">Basically, heat pipes have two components, namely: <span> Hollow cylinder</span> and a <span> Working fluid.</span></div><br>
           <span class="subheading">Hollow cylinder:</span> A sealed hollow cylinder is the framework for the heat pipe. The material for the
          cylinder must be chosen based on the compatibility with the working fluid and the conductive
          efficiency of the material. Copper is usually chosen for heat pipes where water is the working
          fluid. This cylinder has three parts.<br><br>
          1) <span>Evaporator</span> : This is the part that is connected to the heat source, receives the heat input
          and conducts it to the next part.<br>
          2) <span>Condenser</span> : The end that is opposite to the evaporator is the condenser. In simple terms
          the part where the heat inputs and liquid evaporates is called the evaporator section of heat
          pipe and the part of where the liquid condenses is called the condenser section of heat pipe.
          The condenser is the heat output port as it is connected to a heat sink.<br>
          3) <span>Adiabatic region</span> : The part of the cylinder between the evaporator and the condenser is
          the adiabatic region. This part is mainly responsible for the conduction of heat rather than input
          and output.<br><br>
          
           <span class="subheading">Working fluid:</span> The crucial component that is the spine of the whole process is the working fluid.
          A wick structure is lining the inner part of the hollow cylinder. This wick structure is to soak up
          the optimum amount of the working fluid. The main function of the working fluid is phase
          transition on exposure to heat at the evaporator end and condense at the condenser end by
          removing heat. These fluids are selected based on the temperature range of operation. For
          higher environmental temperatures, Indium and lower temperatures liquid Helium can be used
          as a working fluid. Majority of the heat pipes use water with the operating temperature at 298K to 573K.<br><br>
          <i class="fas fa-long-arrow-alt-right"></i> A vacuum pump is attached once the heat pipes are organized to create a vacuum
          environment, necessary for the working of the heat pipe.<br></p>

  <div id="Principles" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content-2 mobile_hide" id="principles" style="text-align: justify;">
          <h2 class="my-5">Principles of Heat pipe</h2>
          <p>
               <span class="subheading">Thermal conductivity:</span> For proper functioning of the heat pipe, the materials chosen for
              its construction must have an excellent ability to conduct heat. Copper has the highest
              thermal conductivity and thus makes an excellent heat pipe material.<br><br>
              
               <span class="subheading">Phase trasition:</span> Finding a working fluid that is appropriate for phase transfer from
              liquid to gas and vice versa is the mainstay of this process. Such a fluid must be
              saturated and require minimal energy to undergo phase transition.<br><br>
  
               <span class="subheading">Capillary action:</span> The working fluid, once heated up, evaporates and gets condensed to
              liquid again at the condenser end. To replace this fluid back at the evaporator end for the
              next cycle, a wick (porous) structure is used. This structure has many variants like
              grooved, mesh, sintered, etc. The condensed fluid is taken up through the wick back to
              the evaporator end by capillary action through its grooves and pores.<br><br>
              </p>
      </div> 
  </div>
  
  <div id="Working" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content-1 mobile_hide" id="working" style="text-align: justify;">
          <h2 class="my-5">Working of Heat pipe</h2>
          <p>
           <span class="subheading">Heat injection:</span> The evaporator receives heat input from the source. This source can be an electronic device or any machinery that generates heat while working. The evaporator injectsheat from source.<br><br>
              
           <span class="subheading">Evaporation:</span> The working fluid at the evaporator end evaporates from the wick. Its gaseous form enters the adiabatic chamber.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Vapour pressure increases:</span> The pressure exerted by the vapour over the working fluid increases inside this vacuum sealed cavity.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Latent heat absorbed:</span> When the phase changes at a constant temperature, the resultant release of latent heat is absorbed by the working fluid. As a result, temperature at the evaporator end of the pipe decreases.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Pressure difference:</span> The discrepancy in the pressure between both the ends of the tube is translated by rapid transfer of the vapour to the condenser end, thus equalizing the pressure.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Condensation:</span> On reaching the condenser end, the lower temperature condenses the vapours to the working fluid.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Latent heat released:</span> Condensation of the vapour to the working fluid releases latent heat that is transferred to the condenser end.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Heat sink:</span> From the condenser end, heat if transferred to a heat sink, that releases the heat energy to the environment.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Capillary action:</span> The condensed liquid is absorbed by the wick structure, through which it moves to the evaporator end by capillary action.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Cycle repeats:</span> The entire process is faster than most conventional methods of thermal management. Once the working fluid returns to the evaporator end, and the next wave of heat input is received, the cycle begins again.<br><br>

  <div id="Advantages" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content-1 mobile_hide" id="advantages" style="text-align: justify;">
          <h2 class="my-5">Advantages of Heat pipe</h2>
          <p>
           <span class="subheading">High thermal conductivity:</span> T1 inch diameter pipe of 2 feet long can transfer nearly 3.7  KW on heat energy.<br><br>
              
           <span class="subheading">Light weight:</span> Vacuum sealed hollow container with minimal working fluid to accommodate the pressure changes is the reason for the lightness of the structure.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Low maintenance:</span> They are self heat recovery devices and so, wear and tear is very minimal. Hence, continuous maintenance is not needed.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Passive operation:</span> They do not require any mechanical or electrical input for their function, thereby proving to be greatly efficient. <br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Fast thermal response:</span> When compared to a normal copper rod, the heat pipes transfer heat faster to the output end. This is because copper rod transfers heat only by conduction. Whereas, heat pipes combine the principles of thermal conduction, along with phase transition, making it a superconductor.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Long life:</span> Since the materials are subject to very minimal wear and tear, these heat pipes can work efficiently and have a longer lifetime.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Low operating cost:</span> The simplicity in the construction and passive working has translated to a financially efficient heat pipe technology.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Zero cross-contamination:</span> The source provides heat input in streams and the heat sink is physically separated from the heat pipe. Hence, there is zero contamination of heat.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Environmentally safe:</span> Heat pipes are beneficial to the environment as well, in being a passive energy independent and efficient process.<br><br>
              </p>
      </div>
  </div>
  
  <div id="Applications" class="tabcontent">
      <div class="content-1 mobile_hide" id="applications" style="text-align: justify;">
          <h2 class="my-5">Applications of Heat pipe</h2>
          <p>
           <span class="subheading">Space:</span> Like every other machinery, electronic devices used in satellites and spacecraft also generate heat. There are many major drawbacks of thermal management in space. Microgravity environment, limited electricity, varying external temperatures like eclipses and very limited maintenance facilities. The characteristics that make heat pipes suited to these adverse conditions are capillary action (even in the absence of gravity), low weight, no external energy requirements, and isothermal function.<br><br>
              
           <span class="subheading">Computer systems:</span> All devices from power supplies, desktops, laptops, microprocessors, audio amplifiers, high performance computers and gaming equipment have one main feature as their drawback. Heat generation! Employing heat pipes in computers prove to be very effective, less space consuming and real-time cooling.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Medical field:</span> Many of the radiological equipment generate a considerable amount of heat. Using heat pipes will decrease the space occupied, decrease the maintenance costs and weigh much less.<br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems:</span> Heat in HVAC appliances come either from the supply or exhaust air streams. Using heat loops, these can be effectively managed, with the added benefit of affordability and better functioning. <br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Compact electronic enclosures:</span> When the world is seeking new ways to miniaturize electronic devices, the need for a proportionately small thermal management system can be met by heat pipes. This can work as a compact cooling system for any kind of electronic enclosure and cabinets. <br><br>
  
           <span class="subheading">Plastic moulding Industry:</span> Heat pipes are also used in the plastic injection moulding industry. The die of plastic injection moulding is water cooled in many plants but the heat pipe is a better solution as it increases the life of the die and also the quality of plastic produced.<br><br>

                         <span class="subheading">Thermal conductivity:</span> For proper functioning of the heat pipe, the materials chosen for
                        its construction must have an excellent ability to conduct heat. Copper has the highest
                        thermal conductivity and thus makes an excellent heat pipe material.<br><br>
                        
                         <span class="subheading">Phase trasition:</span> Finding a working fluid that is appropriate for phase transfer from
                        liquid to gas and vice versa is the mainstay of this process. Such a fluid must be
                        saturated and require minimal energy to undergo phase transition.<br><br>
            
                         <span class="subheading">Capillary action:</span> The working fluid, once heated up, evaporates and gets condensed to
                        liquid again at the condenser end. To replace this fluid back at the evaporator end for the
                        next cycle, a wick (porous) structure is used. This structure has many variants like
                        grooved, mesh, sintered, etc. The condensed fluid is taken up through the wick back to
                        the evaporator end by capillary action through its grooves and pores.<br><br>

                     <span class="subheading">Heat injection:</span> The evaporator receives heat input from the source. This source can be an electronic device or any machinery that generates heat while working. The evaporator injectsheat from source.<br><br>
                        
                     <span class="subheading">Evaporation:</span> The working fluid at the evaporator end evaporates from the wick. Its gaseous form enters the adiabatic chamber.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Vapour pressure increases:</span> The pressure exerted by the vapour over the working fluid increases inside this vacuum sealed cavity.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Latent heat absorbed:</span> When the phase changes at a constant temperature, the resultant release of latent heat is absorbed by the working fluid. As a result, temperature at the evaporator end of the pipe decreases.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Pressure difference:</span> The discrepancy in the pressure between both the ends of the tube is translated by rapid transfer of the vapour to the condenser end, thus equalizing the pressure.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Condensation:</span> On reaching the condenser end, the lower temperature condenses the vapours to the working fluid.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Latent heat released:</span> Condensation of the vapour to the working fluid releases latent heat that is transferred to the condenser end.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Heat sink:</span> From the condenser end, heat if transferred to a heat sink, that releases the heat energy to the environment.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Capillary action:</span> The condensed liquid is absorbed by the wick structure, through which it moves to the evaporator end by capillary action.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Cycle repeats:</span> The entire process is faster than most conventional methods of thermal management. Once the working fluid returns to the evaporator end, and the next wave of heat input is received, the cycle begins again.<br><br>

                     <span class="subheading">Light weight:</span> Vacuum sealed hollow container with minimal working fluid to accommodate the pressure changes is the reason for the lightness of the structure.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Low maintenance:</span> They are self heat recovery devices and so, wear and tear is very minimal. Hence, continuous maintenance is not needed.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Passive operation:</span> They do not require any mechanical or electrical input for their function, thereby proving to be greatly efficient. <br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Fast thermal response:</span> When compared to a normal copper rod, the heat pipes transfer heat faster to the output end. This is because copper rod transfers heat only by conduction. Whereas, heat pipes combine the principles of thermal conduction, along with phase transition, making it a superconductor.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Long life:</span> Since the materials are subject to very minimal wear and tear, these heat pipes can work efficiently and have a longer lifetime.<br><br>

                     <span class="subheading">Zero cross-contamination:</span> The source provides heat input in streams and the heat sink is physically separated from the heat pipe. Hence, there is zero contamination of heat.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Environmentally safe:</span> Heat pipes are beneficial to the environment as well, in being a passive energy independent and efficient process.<br><br>

                     <span class="subheading">Space:</span> Like every other machinery, electronic devices used in satellites and spacecraft also generate heat. There are many major drawbacks of thermal management in space. Microgravity environment, limited electricity, varying external temperatures like eclipses and very limited maintenance facilities. The characteristics that make heat pipes suited to these adverse conditions are capillary action (even in the absence of gravity), low weight, no external energy requirements, and isothermal function.<br><br>
                        
                     <span class="subheading">Computer systems:</span> All devices from power supplies, desktops, laptops, microprocessors, audio amplifiers, high performance computers and gaming equipment have one main feature as their drawback. Heat generation! Employing heat pipes in computers prove to be very effective, less space consuming and real-time cooling.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Medical field:</span> Many of the radiological equipment generate a considerable amount of heat. Using heat pipes will decrease the space occupied, decrease the maintenance costs and weigh much less.<br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems:</span> Heat in HVAC appliances come either from the supply or exhaust air streams. Using heat loops, these can be effectively managed, with the added benefit of affordability and better functioning. <br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Compact electronic enclosures:</span> When the world is seeking new ways to miniaturize electronic devices, the need for a proportionately small thermal management system can be met by heat pipes. This can work as a compact cooling system for any kind of electronic enclosure and cabinets. <br><br>
            
                     <span class="subheading">Plastic moulding Industry:</span> Heat pipes are also used in the plastic injection moulding industry. The die of plastic injection moulding is water cooled in many plants but the heat pipe is a better solution as it increases the life of the die and also the quality of plastic produced.<br><br>
